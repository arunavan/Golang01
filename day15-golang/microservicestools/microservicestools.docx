 Netflix provides Netflix OSS integrations for Microservices
 apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the GO Environment
 and other  programming model idioms. With a few simple 
annotations you can quickly enable and configure the common patterns 
inside your application and build large distributed systems with 
battle-tested Netflix components. The patterns provided include 
Service Discovery (Eureka), Circuit Breaker (Hystrix), Intelligent
 Routing (Zuul) and Client Side Load Balancing (Ribbon).
